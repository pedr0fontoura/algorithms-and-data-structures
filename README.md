# Data Structures and Algorithms

I made this repository as a reference for implementing and explaining common data structures and algorithms.

If this is your first time seeing this subject, consider looking into more didactic resources. With luck, my interpretation of these concepts will also help you understand them.

One of the best DSA courses that I know of is [The Last Algorithms Course You'll Need](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/) by [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen). 
Prime is very enthusiastic about the subject, and that's the type of person that you should learn from.

I'm not a fan of highly abstract concepts, so I'll do my best to reference real use cases for all the data structures and algorithms here.

It is very likely that most of the use-cases references will be game development related because Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_/Â¯
